      # Gets an instance's Amazon ID by its "id" attribute as reported
      # by AWSM. When an instance is added via the API, the JSON that's
      # returned contains an "id" attribute for that instance. Developers
      # may save that ID so they can later discover an instance's Amazon ID.
      # This is because, when an instance object is first *created* (see
      # #add_instance above), its Amazon ID isn't yet known. The object is
      # created, and *then* later provisioned, so you can't get an Amazon
      # ID until after provisioning has taken place. This method allows you
      # to send an ID to it, and then returns the instance object that
      # corresponds to that ID, which will have an Amazon ID with it if the
      # instance has been provisioned at the time the environment information
      # was read.
      #
      # Note that the ID passed in must be an integer.
      #
      # Usage example:
      #
      #   api = EY::CloudClient.new(token: 'token')
      #   env = api.environment_by_name('my_env')
      #   env.instance_by_id(12345)

      # Sends a request to the API to remove the instance specified by
      # its "provisioned_id" (Amazon ID).

      #
      #   api = EY::CloudClient.new(token: 'token')
      #   env = api.environment_by_name('my_app_production')
      #   bad_instance = env.instance_by_id(12345) # instance ID should be saved upon creation
      #   env.remove_instance(bad_instance)
      #
      # Warnings/caveats:
      #
      # + The API is responsible for actually removing this instance. All this
      #   does is send an appropriate request to the API.
      # + You should look carefully at the API response JSON to see whether or
      #   not the API accepted or rejected your request. If it accepted the
      #   request, that instance *should* be removed as soon as possible.
      # + Note that this is a client that talks to an API, which talks to an
      #   API, which talks to an API. Ultimately the IaaS provider API has the
      #   final say on whether or not to remove an instance, so a failure there
      #   can definitely affect how things work at every point down the line.
      # + If the instance you pass in doesn't exist in the live cloud
      #   environment you're working on, the status should be rejected and thus
      #   the instance won't be removed (because *that* instance isn't there).
      #   This is important to keep in mind for scheduled/auto scaling; if
      #   for some reason the automatically added instance is removed before
      #   a "scale down" event that you might trigger, you may wind up with an
      #   unknown/unexpected number of instances in your environment.
      # + Only works for app/util instances. Raises an error if you pass one
      #   that isn't valid.
